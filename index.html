        <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
        <h3>About this page/about me</h3>
        <p>It has been a couple of years already that I have started learning computer programming through self
            learning.
            Through out those
            times, I
            would say I
            made some progress, however, I never got into THAT hump. I always feel that something is lacking in terms of
            my
            programming skills. I came to think that my programming knowledge is somehow scattered with no solid
            foundation.
            And so Today, 28/04/2021, I decided to 'reboot' my computer programming journey.</p>
        <p>
            Here are some of the strategies that i wish to employ this time around:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>1. Limit Sources.</h5>
                <p>Before, I have been watching different youtube videos, reading different books, and doing different
                    tutorials all at the same time. This made me not able to finish or understand deeply the things and
                    studying.
                    And so this time I decided to go with few sources. </p>

            </li>
        </ul>
